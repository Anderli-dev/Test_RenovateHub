1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anderli-dev/Test_RenovateHub.git
   cd Test_RenovateHub
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.
    You can use .env.sample as a template.
    Make sure to update the values inside .env according to your local environment if needed.

5. Start the application using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
6. Apply migrations after launch: In a new terminal (in parallel with Docker):
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

7. The application will be available at:
- [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

If necessary, you can also create a superuser:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```
